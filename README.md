# openapi-data
For my bachelor thesis I am going to analyze an high amount of openAPI documents.
This repository contains data I collected from swaggerhub running a crawler on it. 

[The code for the crawler is published in the linked repository](https://gitlab.tubit.tu-berlin.de/amit88/swaggerhub-crawler)
Notice that the data in this repository is raw data which had only a first syntax validation. 



## The crawler generated files are
#### the html directory
It contains the HTML representation of the results found by the searching engine of swaggerhub.
#### the links.txt file
a file containing the URLs of all OpenAPI files found in the searching results
#### the api directory
this directory contains the raw openAPI files that I will analyze in a later state
