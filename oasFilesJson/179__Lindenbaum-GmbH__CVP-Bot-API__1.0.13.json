{"openapi":"3.0.0","servers":[{"description":"Local Server","url":"http://localhost:8080"}],"info":{"description":"With Lindenbaum Cognitive Voice API you can easily do things like building your voicebots,\n  which can be reached via phone calls. You can receive speech input of the caller as\n  transcripted text in many languages. Let different voices say your text in this call.\n  After the voicebot dialog you may drop the call (call fully completed by bot) or transfer the call e.g. to the relevant service hotline (human agent required to satisfy caller).\n\n\n  Find documentation about the API provided on our site below voice endpoints.\n\n\n  By some events, such as receiving an incoming phone call or transcription of a callers\n  utterance, Lindenbaum make an HTTP request to an URL to be provided by you. This is called\n  a webhook. To handle a webhook, you need to build a small web application that can accept\n  the HTTP requests. The required webhooks are listed as bot endpoints.\n","version":"1.0.13","title":"Lindenbaum Cognitive Voice Bot API","contact":{"email":"cvp@lindenbaum.eu"},"license":{"name":"Apache 2.0","url":"http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html"}},"tags":[{"name":"bot","description":"endpoints related to text analysis and text responses"}],"security":[{"OAuth2":[]},{"ApiKeyAuth":[]}],"paths":{"/session":{"post":{"tags":["bot"],"summary":"A session with a caller has been established","operationId":"session","description":"A session with a caller has been established","responses":{"204":{"description":"Operation successful"},"400":{"description":"Bad request"}},"requestBody":{"description":"Parameters for the session operation","required":true,"content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/SessionParameters"}}}}}},"/message":{"post":{"tags":["bot"],"summary":"Caller utterance has been transcribed to text","operationId":"message","description":"Caller utterance has been transcribed to text","responses":{"204":{"description":"Operation successful"},"400":{"description":"Bad request"}},"requestBody":{"description":"Parameters for the message operation","required":true,"content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/MessageParameters"}}}}}},"/inactivity":{"post":{"tags":["bot"],"summary":"Call/Session has been inactive","operationId":"inactivity","description":"Call/Session has been inactive.
