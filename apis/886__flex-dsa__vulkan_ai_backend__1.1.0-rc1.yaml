      description:
        This backend implements a simple Authorization Bearer authentication via `jwt` exchanges. When a valid
        e-mail/password pair is given to this endpoint, the server generates an `auth_token` valid for **24 hours**.


        The client is supposed to hold this token to authenticate all the requests done on the other endpoints.

        This endpoint parses the project, campaigns and model from the payload request to run the requested model,
        through our scoring API, either consuming the internal _Flex_ databases or scoring from external files
        uploaded from the `/bases` endpoint, each controlled by the `source` query parameter.


        For _Flex_ operations, the server fixes the amount of jobs that one user can put at a time to 4. If the user insists in running
        even more than that, it will return a 406 response.


        Each modality has its own type of request, but both responses are equal.

      summary: Upload a new base to the user repository
      description:
        Use this endpoint to upload new base files to your user account. The files will be stored
        in the user's own subfolder `{registrationNumber}/{filename}`. This makes the file management
        easier and the user may download any given file and/or enriched/scored file at any given
        moment.


        The upload **must be done** from a form/buttton named `base`, otherwise the backend will not
        recognize and thus raise a 400 response.
