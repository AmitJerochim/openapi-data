    This is the SearchOnMath API description page. The API can be used in two different ways:<br/>
     - /webservice: Accessing SearchOnMath via webservice is the same as accessing it via browser. That is, a user can submit up to 10 queries per day at no cost. SearchOnMath controls this based on the user's IP address.<br/>
     - /webservice/api: Accessing SearchOnMath via API requires the <a href="http://www.searchonmath.com/account/create" target="blank">creation of an account</a>. Once the account has been confirmed by the user, SearchOnMath sends an email containing the 'user name' and the 'api key'. An initial credit of 100 queries is also added to user's account. Once logged in, users can buy more credits from <a href="https://www.searchonmath.com/account/buy-queries">the SearchOnMath store</a>.<br/><br/>
       The <a href="#/default/get_webservice">/webservice</a> and <a href="#/default/post_webservice_api">/webservice/api</a> sections below contain more details about expected parameters and responses.
