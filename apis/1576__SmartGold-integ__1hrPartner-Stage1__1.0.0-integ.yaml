        Authorize secure upload of a customer's binary document such a photograpgh, or identification proof scan        
        to the storage.  These uploads are a two step process.  In the first step an authorization is completed.
        On successful authorization caller will receive an upload endpoint (URL).  A 'PUT' operation is expected to
        this URL with the file binary data.  
        
        We highly recommend using the client library (uploadclient.js) for uploads.  If you are rolling your own upload 
        routine using this API the following parameter is important.

        UploadDocRequest.type should be 'CUSTOMER_DOC'

        On successful authorization caller will receive a download endpoint (URL).  A 'GET' operation is expected to
        this URL to receive the file binary data.  
        
        We highly recommend using the client library (uploadclient.js) for downloads.  This URL is part of the response 
        you received during a previous upload.  This URL cannot be constructed using parameters available to you.  So it is
        important to save the URL you receive during uplaod for reading using this API.
