This API implements its own security and access control to allow wider usage of this service while maintaining security and auditing at the individual user level.\nBasic Auth is used with Username and passwords from the mongo users of the Atlas project. To be able to interact with the API, you need to have a db user in the `RequestDB` database. This will be replaced by Oauth authentication in future versions."},"security":[{"httpAuth":[]}],"paths":{"/ping":{"get":{"summary":"Server heartbeat operation","description":"Check to see if the API is up and functioning.","security":[],"responses":{"200":{"description":"OK","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"pong":{"type":"boolean"}}}}}}}}},"/clusters/{groupID}":{"get":{"summary":"Returns all clusters for a given project id","description":"Returns a list of all clusters for the provided project (group)","parameters":[{"name":"groupID","in":"path","required":true,"schema":{"type":"string"}}],"responses":{"200":{"description":"OK","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"type":"array","items":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/clusterInfo"},"example":[{"id":"jlkjklj-sadasda-dasdasdas-dasdasd","clusterType":"SHARDED"},{"id":"234423-23423423-gdsgdgdsgd-34242343","name":"REPLICASET"}]}}}},"404":{"description":"The provided group/project id does not exist"}}}},"/jobs/{groupID}/clusters/{clusterID}":{"post":{"summary":"Requests an ftdc collection job for a cluster","description":"Triggers a request for a log collection job of type ftdc.","parameters":[{"name":"groupID","in":"path","required":true,"schema":{"type":"string"}},{"name":"clusterID","in":"path","required":true,"schema":{"type":"string"}}],"responses":{"200":{"description":"OK","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"jobId":{"type":"string"}}}}}},"400":{"description":"The provided group or cluster id does not exist."}}},"get":{"summary":"Returns all jobs for a given cluster","description":"Returns all jobs for a given group and cluster.\nIncludes the job ID, as well as the latest status.
