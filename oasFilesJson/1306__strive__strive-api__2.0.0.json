{"openapi":"3.0.1","info":{"title":"Strive Cloud API","description":"Welcome to the __Strive Technologies API Documentation__. This page covers detailed descriptions of Strive's publicly available API endpoints, data structures, throttling information and best practices for usage. The Strive Technologies REST API exposes two types of endpoints.\n- __Analytics Query API__ can be used to pull raw, real-time analytics data from both Products Flink and METRIX. To access the Analytics Query API, you need an __Analytics Query Token__, which can be found in your dashboard's [settings page](https://dashboard.strivetech.io/portal/account/settings).\n\n- __Platform Management API__ can be used to control dashboard features via API (Create new trackers, change a swarm configuration, etc.). To access the Platform Management API, you need a __Platform Management Token__, which can be found in your dashboard's [settings page](https://dashboard.strivetech.io/portal/account/settings).\n\n__Authorization__ is done via Bearer Authentication. Please note that you need different API tokens for both API types (Analytics Query and Platform Management).\n\n__Please note__ that the API responses might contain fields which are not documented yet. Those fields are not stable yet and might change in the future. Please only use fields which are well documented and therefore part of the API.","termsOfService":"https://strivetech.io/terms-and-conditions/","contact":{"email":"info@strivetech.io"},"version":"2.0.0"},"externalDocs":{"description":"Find out more about
