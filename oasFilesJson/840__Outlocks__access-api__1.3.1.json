{"openapi":"3.0.0","info":{"version":"1.3.1","title":"Outlocks™ Access Management API","description":"---\n# General Information\n\nThis document describes the REST APIs for integrating with Outlocks™ Access Management System (OAMS) and its core functionalities. The OAMS consists of two main systems: Wi-Key Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) and Knock Code Technology (KCT)\n\nThe Wi-Key management system consists of these main entities: Locks, Users and Work orders. Based on these entities, access definitions may be configured and changed. Locks represent the actual locking device that is installed in the field and needs to be accessed (unlocked). An individual lock is identified in the system by it's unique attributes - Log number and Product key. A User represents the individual who needs access to the locks, and holds information required for operations such as the username, password and smartphone device that is used for access. Work orders are the specific definitions of the access and include attributes such as Dates, Times, Geofencing etc. The work orders are linked to the Locks and the Users to define for a group of individuals what locks they may access under what specific set of rules defined in the work order.\n\nThe Knock Code technology access management system consists of these main elements: Locking units, Key holders and KnocKeys. Based on these entities, access definitions may be configured and edited. A locking unit represents the actual device that is installed in the field and needs to be accessed (unlocked). An individual lock is identified in the system by its unique attribute - Log number. A Key Holder represents the person who has access to this lock and holds required information such as his mobile number for the purpose of requesting codes and other details. A KnocKey represents the device used to transmit codes to the lock, and it is identified by its unique identifier - the serial number. In addition to these three elements, an access definition will contain information about the access code used - type of the code, schedule of use and the code itself. When using Service Codes in the access definition, the access management system allows dynamic control of the service code issuance by geolocation and scheduling: recurring time windows (days of the weeks and hours of the day) in which a service code may be issued, or Work orders - specific dates and times in which a service code may be issued.   \n\nPortal Users represent inividuals who perform API work that is more administrative in nature, and they are in charge of defining & updating other entities in the OAMS like Users, Locks, Sites & Work orders that govern the access provided to other users.\n\nAll APIs are exposed over a secured HTTPS channel.\n\n---\n# API Use Flow\n\nIn order to use most of the API's endpoints, an valid access token is required. \n\nA token can be acquired using the `/identity/tokens` endpoint.\n\nThe token management complies with the JWT open standard. Means that when sending a request to an endpoint that requires a token, the **request header** must include:\n\n`\"Authorization\":\"Bearer <Actual token id>\"`\n\n---\n# Currently Available Endpoints\n\n  # 1.

We will employ 3 code groups: successful responses, client errors and servers errors. Status codes are defined by section 10 of RFC 2616.\n\n**Successful response:**\n- **`200` - OK**. The request has succeeded. The meaning of a success varies depending on the endpoint. The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body.\n- **`204` - No Content**. This response will return if a DELETE type request was completed successfully.\n\n**Client error responses:**\n- **`400` - Bad Request**. This response means that the server could not understand the request due to invalid input. According to the endpoint in question, the response body may hold an error object with additional data (see section below)\n\n- **`401` - Unauthorized**. Although the HTTP standard specifies \"unauthorized\", semantically this response means \"unauthenticated\". That is, the client must authenticate itself to get the requested response.\n\n- **`404` - Not Found**. The server can not find requested resource. \n\n**Server error responses:**\n\n- **`500` - Internal Server Error**. The server has encountered a situation it doesn't know how to handle.\n\n- **`503` - Service Unavailable**. The server is not ready to handle the request. Common causes are a server that is down for maintenance or that is overloaded. \n---\n\n# Error Response Object\n\nFor some of the response error you may get from the API, the reponse body will contain an error object with the following structure:\n```\n{\n  \"AppStatusCode\": \"string\",\n  \"Message\": \"string\",\n  \"Reason\": \"string\"\n}\n```\n`appStatusCode` will contain a string constant from the list provided in the HTTP codes section above. `message` and `reason` may contain forther information about the error that occured. \n\nHere is an example of an error object you may get if you request an access key for a lock that belongs to multiple sites without providing a site id in the request:\n\nThe HTTP status code will be `400` - Bad request, and the response body will be:\n\n```\n{\n  \"AppStatusCode\": \"MISSING_SITE_ID\",\n  \"Message\": \"Site ID must be provided for lock: '718A900002' in order to request an access key\",\n  \"Reason\": \"Lock is linked to multiple sites: ee83eaef-1b04-484f-9b83-d9b70d22c533, edee45c4-12e2-4921-bde6-a18219257570\"\n}\n```\n---\n"},"servers":[{"url":"/api/v1"}],"paths":{"/identity/tokens":{"post":{"tags":["auth"],"summary":"Get token for API requests","description":"Sends a request for login with the provided identification credentials.
