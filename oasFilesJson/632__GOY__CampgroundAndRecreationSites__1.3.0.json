{"openapi":"3.0.0","info":{"title":"Campground and Recreation Sites API","description":"## API Usage from a mobile client\n\nThe typical use case for a mobile client of this API is as follows:\n\n1. Call the *Request detailed records for all sites* (`GET /sites`) endpoint for the users' language of choice to completely populate the list of sites. Store the `sites_sha1` value from that payload.\n2. On a regular schedule, call the *Request a summary of all sites* (`GET /sites-summary`) endpoint to check for changes in the site data. If the summary has the same `sites_sha1` that was stored previously, there were no changes. Otherwise, store the new `sites_sha1` value and iterate through the client's database of sites:\n    1. If the client `site_id` does not appear in the summary, delete that site from the client database.\n    2. If the client `changed_ts` value is earlier (lower) than that in the summary, temporarily save the corresponding `site_id` value(s). \n3. If there are saved `site_id` value(s) from step 2.2, call the *Request detailed record(s) for one or some sites* (`GET /sites/{site_id}`) endpoint and pass the saved `site_id` value(s). Replace the client's copy of the site(s) with the data in the response. Also replace the associated site(s) images via the `image_url` field.\n\nIf necessary, the client may calculate its own SHA1 hash to compare with that returned by the API:\n\n1. Iterate through the sites in ascending order by `site_id`.\n2. Gather the `site_id` and `changed_ts` values as strings for each site.\n3. Concatenate all the strings together (`<site_id_1><changed_ts_1><site_id_2><changed_ts_2><site_id_3>`...) without delimiters and take the SHA1 hash of the entire string.\n\n*While it is always possible for the client to calculate its own SHA1 hashes, these are provided by the server to a) simplify the client's work, and b) guard against a client deleting records missing from a truncated response (per step 2.1, above). A truncated JSON payload should be invalid, so if the `sites_sha1` hash is absent, the response should be abandoned.*\n\n\n## Base API URIs\n\n- Production: `https://api.yukon.ca/campground-and-recreation/v1`\n- UAT: `https://api.cms-uat.yukon.ca/campground-and-recreation/v1`\n\nThe URI standard for production Government of Yukon APIs is:\n\n    https://api.yukon.ca/<service-name>/v<major-version-number>/<resource>\n\n## Authentication\n\nAll requests are authenticated using an `api-key` HTTP header passed with each request.\n\nAuthentication is optional for the development and User Acceptance Test (UAT) environments.\n\n## Language\n\nThe choice of language for the site data is made using the `accept-language` HTTP header passed with each request.\n\nThe first two characters of the header value must be either `en` or `fr`. Any other value will be interpreted as `en`.\n\n## HTTP status codes\n\n- `200 OK`: The request succeeded.\n- `400 Bad Request`: There is a syntax error in the request parameters.\n- `401 Unauthorized`: The `api-key` header is absent or its value is invalid.\n- `404 Not Found`: The requested endpoint does not exist.\n\nIf a request does not match any records, that is still a successful request with an empty `data` list.\n\n## Version history\n\n- 1.3.0 (2019-12-24): Replace `dock` field with `beach`.\n- 1.2.2 (2019-11-18): Change in API URI standard.\n- 1.2.1 (2019-10-28): The `highway_name` field is no longer mandatory, for sites not near a highway. Added some `image_url` field details. Added version history section.\n- 1.2.0 (2019-10-24): Simplified a few list fields into single strings. Simplified the `image` object into a `image_url` string. Removed several fields no longer needed (particularly Boolean fields). Specified which fields are mandatory. Specified that `longitude` is negative for all Yukon coordinates.\n- 1.1.0 (2019-10-08): Simplified the `images` list field into a single `image` object.\n- 1.0.0 (2019-10-01): Initial OpenAPI definition.\n","version":"1.3.0","contact":{"email":"eservices@gov.yk.ca"}},"servers":[{"url":"https://virtserver.swaggerhub.com/GOY/CampgroundAndRecreationSi0","description":"SwaggerHub API Auto Mocking"},{"url":"https://api.yukon.ca/campground-and-recreation/v1","description":"Production"},{"url":"https://api.cms-uat.yukon.ca/campground-and-recreation/v1","description":"UAT"}],"security":[{"ApiKeyAuth":[]}],"paths":{"/sites":{"get":{"summary":"Request detailed records for all sites","operationId":"allSites","parameters":[{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/AcceptLanguage"}],"responses":{"200":{"description":"Sites","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"data":{"type":"array","items":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/SiteDetail"}},"sites_count":{"type":"integer","example":1},"sites_sha1":{"type":"string","description":"SHA1 hash of concatenation of string forms of all site_id and changed_ts records in data list","example":"f4f460ca2ae2d81efd4f28cc22682edbb8e493cd"}}}}}},"400":{"description":"There is a syntax error in the request parameters."},"401":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/UnauthorizedError"},"404":{"description":"The requested endpoint does not exist."}}}},"/sites/{site_id}":{"get":{"summary":"Request detailed record(s) for one or some sites","operationId":"someSites","parameters":[{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/AcceptLanguage"},{"in":"path","name":"site_id","description":"One or more unique site identifiers.","example":[123,124,85],"required":true,"schema":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"integer"}}}],"responses":{"200":{"description":"Sites","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"data":{"type":"array","items":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/SiteDetail"}},"sites_count":{"type":"integer","example":1},"sites_sha1":{"type":"string","description":"SHA1 hash of concatenation of string forms of all site_id and changed_ts records in data list","example":"f4f460ca2ae2d81efd4f28cc22682edbb8e493cd"}}}}}},"400":{"description":"There is a syntax error in the request parameters."},"401":{"description":"The api-key header is absent or its value is invalid."},"404":{"description":"The requested endpoint does not exist."}}}},"/sites-summary":{"get":{"summary":"Request a summary of all sites","operationId":"summarySites","parameters":[{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/AcceptLanguage"}],"responses":{"200":{"description":"Sites","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"data":{"type":"array","items":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/SiteSummary"}},"sites_count":{"type":"integer","example":1},"sites_sha1":{"type":"string","description":"SHA1 hash of concatenation of string forms of all site_id and changed_ts records in data list","example":"f4f460ca2ae2d81efd4f28cc22682edbb8e493cd"}}}}}},"400":{"description":"There is a syntax error in the request parameters."},"401":{"$ref":"#/components/responses/UnauthorizedError"},"404":{"description":"The requested endpoint does not exist."}}}}},"components":{"securitySchemes":{"ApiKeyAuth":{"type":"apiKey","in":"header","name":"api-key","description":"eServices-assigned API access key (required for production URI only)"}},"responses":{"UnauthorizedError":{"description":"The api-key header is absent or its value is invalid."}},"parameters":{"AcceptLanguage":{"in":"header","name":"accept-language","description":"The first two characters of the header value must be either en or fr .
